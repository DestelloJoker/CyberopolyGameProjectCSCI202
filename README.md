# CyberopolyGameProjectCSCI202
# Created by Austin, Ryan, and Hunter for SDEV 265
This project was the cumulative work of us three individuals to make a project based on the game Monopoly. 
This project lacks some of the unique features like house, and hotels, auctioning, trading, color set rent increases, and a server client useable system
So players can play off their own client and not a local client through a single computer.
Before Playing, make sure to read the about cyberopoly word doc since it will contain information about the game 
and how each part works.
